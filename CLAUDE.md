# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static portfolio/documentation site ("Bridge to Purpose") hosted on **GitHub Pages**. There is no build system, no package manager, and no test framework — all pages are vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/digi-mar-ai-workflow.yml`), which uploads the entire `docs/` directory to GitHub Pages. No manual deploy step is needed.

## Repository Structure

All deliverables live under `docs/`:

- `docs/index.html` — Portfolio landing page (hub linking to both projects)
- `docs/digital-marketing-ai/index.html` — 3-month freelancer roadmap for AI-assisted digital marketing
- `docs/quran-education-app/index.html` — Al-Quran Education app documentation (Quran recitations, translations, AI Halal checking, prayer tools)
- `docs/quran-education-app/terms_and_conditions.html` — Legal terms for the Quran app

## Architecture & Conventions

**Theming** — All pages implement a dark/light mode toggle via CSS custom properties (`--bg`, `--text`, etc.). The user's preference is persisted in `localStorage`. The hub (`docs/index.html`) also respects the OS `prefers-color-scheme` media query as a default.

**Typography** — `docs/index.html` uses **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Google Fonts); project sub-pages use **Inter**. Font loading is done via `<link>` in `<head>`.

**Styling approach** — Styles are written inline in `<style>` blocks within each HTML file (no external `.css` files). CSS variables drive the colour palette; `clamp()` is used for fluid typography and spacing.

**JavaScript** — Kept minimal and inline in `<script>` blocks. Only used for the theme toggle and minor DOM interactions.

**No shared components** — Each page is fully self-contained. If you need to update a shared element (e.g., navigation, footer), you must edit every file individually.
